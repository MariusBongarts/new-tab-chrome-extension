# Five habit tracker - LocalStorage

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/RominaMartin/pen/Pdpbjo](https://codepen.io/RominaMartin/pen/Pdpbjo).

You'll be able to keep track of five habits of your choice. You can custom each habit name and its color. You won't loose any progress made since it uses localStorage to keep it all.

If the month changes you'll have the chance to keep the same habits or modify them. You'll be able to see the previous/next data if there is as well.

This tracker is Sean McCabe idea's so you can check his page and learn more about it.
